        <h2>More About Me...</h2>
        <p">
            The company was located on Balintawak, Quezon City which very far on my place. With this, I not consider this as difficulty but instead challenges because in exchange of this I will learn more.
            I became Software Developer in Vb6 and start exploring on it. Also assigned in POS Developer in retail which I learned alot of things especially in accounting. Almost 3 years that been there
            and gain more experience in Microsoft SQL Server. Here I learned SQL Queries and Statements, also in additional for my advance learning, I tried to use also Scripting such as Stored Procedure
            Triggers and Scheduler. 2010 also I developed my skills in software development using C# and introduce using .net Framework. After this,I decided to apply in Alabang, which this is the nearest
            area on my home, and to consider the commute and travel it saves time on it. Here I assigned as Windows Mobile Developer, which I integrates program using C# in Windows CE. My project here is 
            parking ticketing system. Aside from this, I look again another opportunity that is 2014, where I applied in BASS which handle Maritime Operations and I assigned on SQL Reporting Developer, Here
            my skills in Database improves more, and also been engage on some technology integeration like Microsoft Mail Merge, which the report was integrate on it a automatically generates report based on
            client requirements.
          </p>
          <p>2016, I jumped on Paranaque, which I stay here almost 6 years of my working experience, with this one I enhance my skills in C#.net and also gain another technology stacks like MySQL, Python, RPA, DB2, and ASP.net.
          as it continous, I met many people there which helps me to improve my skills especially in communication. Also I lead there as their senior consultant which I guides those junior developer in Software Development.
          We also follow SDLC so that there will be standard in coding. And the most I like on this company was the client is very helpful and has "Malasakit". which I owes alot...    
          </p>
          <p>
          2022, after pandemic... I decided to left on this company and find another company which can help me to improve my skills on Web Development. That why I applied on Verete Global Solution. They help me 
          on my Web Development Career. They give us 2 month extensive training in Web Developmen using React.JS (MERN). On this I learned alot in web development, but there is no available client for Web Development.
          Regarding on this, I did not consider this again as my difficulty but instead as a challenge again. Which they introduce us in Banking Company which deals in data management. They are using IBM Oracle and 
          DataStage in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) their data in database. I been here for 1 year and 6 months.
          </p>
          <p>
          And today, I'm here again, learn again in web development and concentrate in Front-end Developer and soon will be hired as a Web Developer.
